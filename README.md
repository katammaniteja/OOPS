### Base class Pointer pointing to derived class object 
- Base class pointer can point on derived class object
- But only those functions which are in base class, can be called
- If derived class is having overrides functions they will not be called unless base class functions 
are declared as virtual
- Derived class pointer cannot point on base class object
