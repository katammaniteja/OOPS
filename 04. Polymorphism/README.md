### Function Overriding 
- Redefining a function of base class in derived class
- Function overriding is used for achieving runtime polymorphism
- Prototype of a overrides function must be exactly same as base class function
### Virtual Functions 
- Virtual functions are used for achieving polymorphism
- Base class can have virtual functions
- Virtual functions can be overrides in derived class
- Pure virtual functions must be overrides by derived class
### Polymorphism 
- Same name different actions
- Runtime Polymorphism is achieved using function overriding
- Virtual functions are abstract functions of base class
- Derived class must override virtual function
- Base class pointer pointing to derived class object and a override function is called
### Abstract class 
- Class having pure virtual function is a abstract class
- Abstract class can have concrete also.
- Object of abstract class cannot be created
- Derived class can must override pure virtual function, otherwise it will also become a abstract 
class.
- Pointer of abstract class can be created
- Pointer of abstract class can hold object of derived class
- Abstract classes are used for achieving polymorphism
- Base class can be Concrete
- Abstract with some concrete and some pure virtual functions
- All virtual functions
