### Object-Oriented Programming
Features of OOPS
- Abstraction
- Data Hiding
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Classes
- Class is a blue print of an object
- Class in a group of objects
- Class is a design of object
- Many object can be created from same class
- Object consumes memory equal to sum of sizes of all data members
- Member functions donâ€™t occupy memory
- Member functions are called depending on object
- . Dot operator is used for accessing members of object
- Memory allocated for object is also called as instance
### Pointer to an Object
- A pointer of type class can be created
- A pointer can point on existing object
- A new object can be created in heap using pointer
- Arrow operator is used for accessing members of an object using pointer
### Data Hiding
- Data members of a class class are usually declared as Private or Protected,
- They can be accessed only inside the class and child classes
- Data finding protects data from mishandling
### Constructors
- Constructor is a member function of a class
- It will have same name as class name
- It will not have return type
- Its should be public
- It can be declared as private also in some cases
- It is called when object is created
- It is used for initialising an object
- It can be overloaded
- If its not defined then class will have a default constructor
- Constructor can take default arguments
### Types of constructors
- Non-argument constructor
- Parameterised constructor
- Copy constructor
### All types of Member Functions 
- Constructors - called when object is created
- Accessors - used for knowing the value of data members
- Mutators - used for changing value of data member
- Facilitator - actual functions of class
- Enquiry - used for checking if an object satisfies some condition
- Destructor - used for releasing resources used by object
